						To support that feature, angular 2+ (just angular) has a pluggable rendering system, so now you can even do native apps using

						If it's something that's pretty essential to making a single page app work, chances are angular is going to
						at least have some basic support, and usually its enough. Obviously if you need a mapping framework like leaflet
						or need charts, etc., you're going to include other libraries, but for the basics of the app itself, Angular provides all.

						Here's the  basic demo app, it's got the router (which also now supports nested routes, optional states, it's very nice),
						it's got 2 different primary page views, and then within each view, there are additional components that are built individually
						like the search bar, or the hero detail view, which is used across both views.

						This is the primary app component, it doesn't do a whole lot, but it shows how you can put html and even css if you want
						in a single file, like a standard webcomponent. Best practices are to keep everything in different files, that'll be shown next
						You can see we've got some additional attributes being added to the link elements, those are router specific directives to activate
						the other route views, and the router-outlet, where the views will be rendered. you can have many nested router-outlets, which
						lets you create whatever kind of ui you want. For this demo, I added the event.subscribe, which simply sets up a subscription
						to the router events, and when there is a successful navigation it updates the urlLocation class property, which are exposed
						to the template. We'll talk more later about how angular handles change detection and knows to update the views.

						Also, notice the selector "my-root". This is the custom element part of it. If you put a standard html tag on your page
						that says <my-root> and include the scripts, my-root will render your app.

						Here's the router config, each route in the application is mapped to a component. You can also setup child routes

						will actually be built into separate files and not loaded until those page views are active (or even can be preloaded in the
						background automatically)

						I added the useHash here, like all modern apps, angular uses html5 push state, but to embed the app and run without a normal server

						typically each major page view is a component as well. Here the component is setup more typically, with all
						the resources in their own files. This is the dashboard, the default view.

						There are a number of things to notice here.
						1. selector - this is the name of the custom html tag that will render this component (exactly like a web component)
						2. the html is in its own file now
						3. all of the styles will automatically be scoped just to apply to this component. this echoes both css modules
							and web components. Currently angular can support several different levels of css view encapsulation, even use
							native shadow dom if its available.
						4. Notice the array has type "Hero", this is very nice since all the methods are deal with hero records can now expect
						   exactly what they are getting, and typescript will give type errors immediately, as well as intellisense,
							 more on that later.

						that's clearly laid out int he main app.module file. The imports section defines what additional
						modules you're using (so other entire bundles of elements, services etc), and then also what components
						this module declares, as well as what services it can provide. (Those additioanl providers for location I added
						to enable the hash location. It is however a nice example of how easy it is to configure the behavior of a module.
						if you want to override how a particular service works, or provider an alternate implemetation of the service,
						you can define it here for dependency injection (more on that later too)). For large projects, being able to
						keep track so concisely of everything that is involved or required by ur module is a life saver.

						Finally, opinionated. Angular is fairly opinionated. You could use it without typescript, but it will be more painful,
						as most of the examples are in typescript. rxjs is baked in, and angular basically thinks you should use (and we will see why).
						The framework comes with solutions to most problems
						and it's easiest to just use them. Angular 2/4 has also taken what I think the wonderful step to produce
						an official style guide,  for people like me, this is a godsend. I want to send off a developer,
						and say, make this component, and i want it to look exactly as if i did it myself,
						and i would do it following the styleguide and so can they. Its awesome.

					<aside class="notes">
						Change detection - is all about how these frameworks compare some current state with some new state
						and figure out if something has changed, and whether there needs to be some re-rendering of the dom.

						Maybe add slide with figures here. Afai understand it, React treats all data as immutables, and
						so if you want the data to update, you pass it a new object, and it can tell the different with
						straight object equality, it then renders the dom virtually, diffs, and then renders the changed areas.
						Vue is a bit more like angular, where you specify which properties count as important data in your data config
						and those are the only values that are watched for changes, and then diffed with virtual dom.
						Angular actually gives you choices here. You can stick to the easiest method, which we saw earlier, and just
						have angular build a change detection class for each of your componenets, and it will figure out
						what data can change, and watch everything, and update the values in the dom accordingly. Or, you
						can tell angular that you are going to use immutable.js, and it will only look at changes based on
						object equality. Or you can go with rxjs, and use observables for data that will change. In the later
						2 cases, you can also tell angular to only search the component trees that are strictly affected by your
						changes.
